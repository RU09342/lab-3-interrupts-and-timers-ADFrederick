#Lab 2 TIMER A Blink
The TIMER peripherals can be used in many situations thanks to it flexibility in features. For this lab, you will be only scratching the surface as to what this peripheral can do. 

For this Lab I Started with the F5529 and FR2311 as both of these were using timer B and then adjusted the code using timer A in the others. I started by setting the LED1 as an ouput and initiallizing it at a low value. Then For the timer control I utilized the submain clock so I could have an easy to work with 1 MHz signal. I then divided it by 8 and set the clock in upmode as this allowed me to play around with frequencies based on the CCR0 value as this is where the clock will reset and sent its interrupt. Then all I did in the interrupt vector was throw an XOR in so that it toggles on the interrupt.
