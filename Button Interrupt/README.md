Lab 3 Butotn Intterupt

For this exercise I have set up the board to flip between two LEDs on each board. To accomplish this I Initialized the LED's pins as outputs and set the first to high and the second to low. Then I enebled one of the buttons on the board as an input and enabled the interrupt to trigger on it's press. The button additionally has a pulup resistor in order to hold it at a high value when it is not pressed meaning the interrupt is triggered on a falling edge. The LEDs are flipped through an XOR operation when the interrupt is triggered. Then, in order to prevent bouncing, I have it wait 1000 clock cycles and then reset the intterupt flag manually. This prevents the mechanical deficiencies of the button to be ignored.
