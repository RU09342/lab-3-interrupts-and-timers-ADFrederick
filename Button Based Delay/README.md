Lab 3 Button Based Delay

For this Excercise I started by defining that I would have 2 interupt Service requests from the button and from the timer. I started with the button to define a variable which sets to high when the button interrupt is activated and resets a variable overflow. In the timer interrupt, it has two functions based on whether the button is pressed or not. If it is pressed, it increases the variable overflow whenever the interrupt is triggered by CCR0. When the button is released, the LED is flipped each time the number of interrupts counts to the number of overflows. This means that the LED if flipped based on the length of time the button is held.
